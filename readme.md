What problem does it solve?
- Socket.io solves the problems it solves is having the ability to keep open ports and real time communication between multiple people
- ExpressJS solves the problem of having to write up a bunch of REALLY time consuming code.  It is a brilliant framework for getting a node.js app up and running with the quickness.

Why would I use it? Alternatives?
- You would use it because it's awesome.  
- Alternatives are KOA, Restify, Hapi

What are good things about it?

- it's quick, powerful and pretty slick.  The docs are stellar for both express and sockets

What are bad things about it?
- deploying to heroku.  Kind of a pain in the ass. Mostly in that we kept getting an h10 error about the 'app crashing' because of the the favicon.ico.  Super annoying.
